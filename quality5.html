        <p>Rohit Sharma has rewritten record books with his incredible achievements in cricket. He holds the record for the highest individual score in ODIs with 264 runs. He is the only batsman to score three double centuries in ODIs, a feat unmatched in history. He has also scored five centuries in a single World Cup edition, the most by any batsman. His ability to score centuries in all three formats proves his versatility and adaptability. He is among the few players to score multiple T20I centuries, showcasing his dominance in the shortest format. He has hit the most sixes in a calendar year, demonstrating his incredible power-hitting ability. His consistent performances across all formats have earned him numerous accolades and awards. He is among the leading run-scorers in IPL history, making him a T20 legend. Rohitâ€™s records reflect his dedication, consistency, and extraordinary talent.</p>
